I needed to get a handle on how the `main.cpp` file in the `daisyduino` project worked, as it seemed to be the core of the chord machine logic. My goal was to understand its structure and how it generated sound based on the hardware controls.

My first step was to get a detailed breakdown of the code's structure and flow. The explanation clarified several key areas.

It starts by including necessary Daisy libraries like `DaisyDuino.h` and defining global variables. These are crucial for the synthesizer's state:
- `DaisyHardware hw`: Represents the Daisy hardware interface.
- `Oscillator osc[4]`: An array of four oscillator objects. This makes sense, as the goal is to generate four-note chords.
- `int notes[4]`: An array to hold the MIDI note values for each of the four oscillators.
- `int chord[10][3]`: A 2D array storing the interval structure (relative to the root note) for 10 different chord types. Each inner array holds the intervals for the 3rd, 5th, and 7th degrees of the chord.
- `int chordNum = 0`: A variable to keep track of which of the 10 chord types is currently selected (indexed 0-9).

The core audio processing happens in the `AudioCallback` function. This is a static function, typical for real-time audio work, and it gets called repeatedly by the hardware at the audio sample rate to fill output buffers.
```cpp
static void AudioCallback(float **in, float **out, size_t size) {
  UpdateControls(); // Read knobs and encoder first

  // Set oscillator frequencies based on calculated MIDI notes
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    osc[i].SetFreq(mtof(notes[i]));  // mtof converts MIDI note to frequency
  }

  // Process each audio sample in the buffer
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    float sig = 0; // Initialize signal for this sample
    // Sum the output of all four oscillators
    for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) { // Use 'j' to avoid shadowing outer loop 'i'
      sig += osc[j].Process();
    }
    // Write the combined signal to both output channels
    out[0][i] = out[1][i] = sig;
  }
}
```
Inside this callback, the first action is calling `UpdateControls()`. This function (detailed below) reads the physical knobs and encoder to update the state variables like `chordNum`, root frequency, and inversion level.

Next, the callback sets the frequency for each of the four oscillators. It iterates through the `osc` array and calls `osc[i].SetFreq()`, passing the result of `mtof(notes[i])`. The `mtof` function (MIDI-to-frequency) converts the MIDI note number stored in the `notes` array into the corresponding frequency in Hertz. This means the `notes` array must have been updated by `UpdateControls()` before this point.

The main part of the callback is a loop that iterates `size` times, where `size` is the number of audio samples in the buffer to be filled. For each sample (`i`):
1. A local variable `sig` is initialized to 0.
2. Another loop iterates through the four oscillators (`j = 0` to `3`). In each iteration, it calls `osc[j].Process()`, which generates the next sample value for that oscillator, and adds this value to `sig`.
3. After summing the outputs of all four oscillators, the final `sig` value is written to both the left (`out[0][i]`) and right (`out[1][i]`) audio output channels for that sample index `i`.

This structure—reading controls, updating oscillator parameters, then generating and mixing samples—is fundamental to how the synthesizer operates in real-time.

The definitions for the chords themselves are set up in the `InitChords()` function.
```cpp
void InitChords() {
  // Defines thirds (3=minor third, 4=major third)
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    chord[i][0] = 3 + ((i + 1) % 2); // Alternates 4, 3, 4, 3...
  }
  chord[8][0] = chord[9][0] = 3; // Dim7 and m7b5 use minor thirds

  // Defines fifths (6=diminished, 7=perfect, 8=augmented)
  chord[0][1] = chord[1][1] = chord[4][1] = chord[5][1] = chord[6][1] =
      chord[7][1] = 7; // Perfect fifth for Maj, min, Maj7, m7, Dom7, mM7
  chord[3][1] = chord[8][1] = chord[9][1] = 6; // Diminished fifth for dim, dim7, m7b5
  chord[2][1] = 8; // Augmented fifth for Aug

  // Defines sevenths (9-12 semitones above root)
  chord[0][2] = chord[1][2] = chord[2][2] = chord[3][2] = 12; // Octave (no 7th) for triads
  chord[4][2] = chord[7][2] = 11; // Major 7th for Maj7, mM7
  chord[5][2] = chord[6][2] = chord[9][2] = 10; // Minor 7th for m7, Dom7, m7b5
  chord[8][2] = 9; // Diminished 7th for dim7
}
```
This function populates the `chord[10][3]` array. Each row corresponds to a chord type, and the columns store the intervals (in semitones above the root) for the 3rd, 5th, and 7th degrees. For example, `chord[0]` (Major Triad) gets `[4, 7, 12]` (Major 3rd, Perfect 5th, Octave). `chord[5]` (Minor 7th) gets `[3, 7, 10]` (Minor 3rd, Perfect 5th, Minor 7th). This array acts as a lookup table for constructing the chords.

The physical controls are read within the `UpdateControls()` function, which in turn calls helper functions: `UpdateEncoder()`, `UpdateKnobs()`, and `UpdateLeds()`.

`UpdateEncoder()` handles the rotary encoder. It increments or decrements `chordNum` when the encoder is turned, ensuring `chordNum` stays within the valid range of 0-9 using the modulo operator. It also resets `chordNum` to 0 if the encoder button is pressed.

`UpdateKnobs()` reads the two potentiometers using `analogRead()`:
```cpp
void UpdateKnobs() {
  // Read knobs and map to MIDI range (0-127) and inversion levels (0-4)
  int freq = 127 * analogRead(PIN_POD_POT_1) / 1023;
  int inversion = 5 * analogRead(PIN_POD_POT_2) / 1023;

  // Calculate the four notes based on root, chord type, and inversion
  notes[0] = freq + (12 * (inversion >= 1)); // Root (or +1 octave if inv >= 1)
  notes[1] = freq + chord[chordNum][0] + (12 * (inversion >= 2)); // 3rd (+1 octave if inv >= 2)
  notes[2] = freq + chord[chordNum][1] + (12 * (inversion >= 3)); // 5th (+1 octave if inv >= 3)
  notes[3] = freq + chord[chordNum][2] + (12 * (inversion >= 4)); // 7th (+1 octave if inv >= 4)
}
```
The first knob's reading is mapped to `freq`, representing the root note of the chord (0-127 MIDI range). The second knob's reading is mapped to `inversion` (0-4). The core logic here is calculating the four MIDI note values for the `notes` array. It takes the root `freq`, adds the appropriate interval from the `chord[chordNum]` lookup table, and then adds 12 (an octave) based on the `inversion` level. For example, `notes[0]` is the root note, but shifted up an octave if `inversion` is 1 or higher. `notes[1]` is the third (root + `chord[chordNum][0]`), shifted up an octave if `inversion` is 2 or higher, and so on. This implements the chord inversions by raising lower chord tones by octaves.

`UpdateLeds()` provides visual feedback by setting the RGB LEDs based on the current `chordNum`. It uses bitwise operations on `chordNum + 1` to create a unique color pattern for each chord type across the two LEDs.

Finally, the `setup()` function initializes the system:
```cpp
void setup() {
  hw = DAISY.init(DAISY_POD, AUDIO_SR_48K); // Initialize Daisy hardware for Pod at 48kHz
  samplerate = DAISY.get_samplerate(); // Get the actual sample rate

  InitSynth(samplerate); // Initialize oscillators (sets waveform, sample rate)
  InitChords(); // Populate the chord interval lookup table

  DAISY.begin(AudioCallback); // Start the audio processing
}
```
It configures the Daisy hardware for the Pod platform and sets the audio sample rate. It calls `InitSynth()` (which likely sets the waveform and sample rate for the `osc` objects) and `InitChords()`. Crucially, it then starts the audio engine by calling `DAISY.begin(AudioCallback)`, passing our `AudioCallback` function to the hardware abstraction layer.

The main `loop()` function is empty (`void loop() {}`). This confirms that all the continuous processing—reading controls, calculating notes, generating audio—happens within the high-priority `AudioCallback` function, driven by the audio hardware interrupts, rather than in the lower-priority main loop.

Getting this detailed breakdown was helpful. It clarified the overall structure: initialize everything in `setup`, then continuously read controls, calculate notes based on chord type and inversion, set oscillator frequencies, and sum their outputs in the `AudioCallback`. Following this, I spent time digging into specific parts, particularly the logic in `UpdateKnobs` for calculating the `notes` array and the summing process for `sig` within the `AudioCallback`. There were several subsequent attempts to refine or adjust the logic, likely focusing on the oscillator configuration or the precise implementation details within the callback, based on this initial understanding. The interaction between the control updates and the audio generation within the single callback function was a key point of focus.
