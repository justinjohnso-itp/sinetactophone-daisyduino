I started by looking at the `ChordMachine.ino` example provided with DaisyDuino to understand how it worked. I asked Copilot to explain the code in the file.

It gave me a high-level overview, mentioning it used four oscillators, knobs for root note and inversion, an encoder for chord type selection, and LEDs for feedback. It also listed the 10 chord types defined in the `chord[10][3]` array and explained the interval structure.

I wanted a bit more detail, so I asked Copilot again, specifically referencing the `main.cpp` file (which was the `ChordMachine.ino` code I was looking at).

This time, the explanation included code snippets showing the hardware interface variables (`DaisyHardware hw`, `Oscillator osc[4]`, etc.), the `AudioCallback` function structure, the `InitChords` function logic with the specific interval assignments, and the control functions (`UpdateEncoder`, `UpdateKnobs`, `UpdateLeds`). It also listed the resulting interval arrays for each chord type, which was helpful.

Next, I needed to figure out how to get audio out of the Daisy Seed itself, since I'm planning to use it on a breadboard initially, not the Pod hardware. I asked Copilot to walk me through wiring a standard 3.5mm headphone jack to the Seed.

Copilot listed the necessary components: the Seed, breadboard, a TRS jack breakout, 10µF capacitors, 4.7kΩ resistors, and jumper wires. It outlined the steps:
1.  Place the Seed on the breadboard.
2.  Connect power (VIN/3V3 and GND).
3.  Identify Audio Out pins 18 (Right) and 19 (Left).
4.  Create an AC coupling circuit for each channel: Audio Out pin -> (+) 10µF cap (-) -> junction -> 4.7kΩ resistor -> GND.
5.  Connect the junction points to the jack: Right channel to Tip, Left channel to Ring, and GND to Sleeve.

It included a text-based diagram:
```
Daisy Seed                           Headphone Jack
-----------                          -------------
Pin 18 (R) ---> 10µF Cap --+--> 4.7kΩ ---> GND
                            |
                            +--> Tip (Right)

Pin 19 (L) ---> 10µF Cap --+--> 4.7kΩ ---> GND
                            |
                            +--> Ring (Left)

GND ------------------------+--> Sleeve (Ground)
```
It also noted the importance of capacitor polarity and mentioned optional 220Ω series resistors for protection with low-impedance headphones.

Finally, I asked Copilot to write a new program for the Daisy Pod, using its specific hardware (two buttons, two pots, encoder). The idea was to have two oscillators, toggled by the buttons and frequency controlled by the pots. A key feature was that if one oscillator was already on, the second one's frequency should lock to a musical scale relative to the first, with the scale selectable via the encoder. I pointed it towards the `examples/` folder for guidance. The chat log ended here before I got the response.
