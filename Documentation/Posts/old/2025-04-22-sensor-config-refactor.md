I started by tweaking the LED brightness for the animations in the Nano code. The current range felt too bright, so I wanted to bring it down significantly.

I adjusted the constants:

```cpp
// Animation constants 
const int SENSOR_MIN_DISTANCE = 50;   // mm - minimum expected detection distance
const int SENSOR_MAX_DISTANCE = 1000; // mm - maximum expected detection distance
const int ACTIVITY_THRESHOLD = 10;     // mm change to trigger activity
const unsigned long IDLE_TIMEOUT = 500; // ms until idle
const int ANIMATION_MIN_SPEED = 20;     // Slower animation speed when close
const int ANIMATION_MID_SPEED = 100;    // Medium animation speed
const int ANIMATION_MAX_SPEED = 250;    // Faster animation speed when far
const uint8_t IDLE_BRIGHTNESS = 10;     // Minimum brightness during idle breath
const uint8_t ACTIVE_BRIGHTNESS = 20;   // Maximum brightness when active
```

This set the range from 10 to 20, which should be much more subtle.

Then, I realized the breathing animation functions needed updating to respect these new limits. I modified `breatheAnimation`:

```cpp
// Animation constants
#define IDLE_BREATH_PERIOD 5000  // Period of breathing cycle in milliseconds

void breatheAnimation(Adafruit_NeoPixel &strip, uint8_t r, uint8_t g, uint8_t b) {
  // Compute angle for full sine wave over period
  float phase = (millis() % IDLE_BREATH_PERIOD) / (float)IDLE_BREATH_PERIOD * TWO_PI;
  float factor = (sin(phase) + 1.0f) * 0.5f;        // 0.0→1.0→0.0
  // Map factor (0.0-1.0) to brightness range (IDLE_BRIGHTNESS to ACTIVE_BRIGHTNESS)
  uint8_t bri = IDLE_BRIGHTNESS + (factor * (ACTIVE_BRIGHTNESS - IDLE_BRIGHTNESS));

  strip.setBrightness(bri);
  for (int i = 0; i < strip.numPixels(); i++) {
    strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(r, g, b));
  }
}
```

And `breatheAnimationHSV`:

```cpp
// HSV-based version of breatheAnimation to match the reference
void breatheAnimationHSV(Adafruit_NeoPixel &strip, uint16_t hue, uint8_t sat) {
  float breath = (sin(millis() / (float)IDLE_BREATH_PERIOD * PI) + 1.0) / 2.0;
  // Map breath factor (0.0-1.0) to brightness range (IDLE_BRIGHTNESS to ACTIVE_BRIGHTNESS)
  uint8_t brightness = IDLE_BRIGHTNESS + (breath * (ACTIVE_BRIGHTNESS - IDLE_BRIGHTNESS));
  
  for (int i = 0; i < strip.numPixels(); i++) {
    strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.ColorHSV(hue, sat, brightness));
  }
}
```

Next, I needed to fix the mapping between the Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors and the LED rings. The physical wiring didn't match the initial code assumptions. I updated the `sensorRings` array to reflect the correct connections:

```cpp
// Maps each ToF sensor index to its corresponding LED ring
Adafruit_NeoPixel* sensorRings[MAX_SENSORS] = {
  &sensorRingB3, // ToF 0 -> LED D7
  nullptr,       // ToF 1 (not used)
  nullptr,       // ToF 2 (not used)
  &sensorRingB1, // ToF 3 -> LED D5
  &sensorRingA3, // ToF 4 -> LED D4
  &sensorRingA2, // ToF 5 -> LED D3
  &sensorRingA1, // ToF 6 -> LED D2
  &sensorRingB2  // ToF 7 -> LED D6
};
```

After fixing the sensor-to-LED mapping, I noticed the colors were now assigned incorrectly based on the physical sides A (D5-D7, warm) and B (D2-D4, cool). I adjusted the `ringColors` array to assign the correct hue to each sensor based on its corresponding LED's physical location:

```cpp
// LED animation colors (HSV hue values) - based on physical layout
// D5-D7 (physical side A): Warm/earth tones
// D2-D4 (physical side B): Cool tones
const uint16_t ringColors[MAX_SENSORS] = {
  5461,   // ToF 0 -> LED D7 (warm: yellow-orange)
  0,      // ToF 1 (not used)
  0,      // ToF 2 (not used)
  0,      // ToF 3 -> LED D5 (warm: red)
  54613,  // ToF 4 -> LED D4 (cool: magenta)
  49151,  // ToF 5 -> LED D3 (cool: blue-purple)
  43690,  // ToF 6 -> LED D2 (cool: blue)
  10922   // ToF 7 -> LED D6 (warm: green)
};
```

Finally, having the sensor channel, LED ring pointer, and color in separate arrays felt disorganized. I decided to refactor this into a single structure for better readability and maintainability.

I defined a `SensorConfig` struct:

```cpp
// Sensor configuration structure to keep all sensor-related mappings in one place
struct SensorConfig {
    uint8_t channel;                 // Multiplexer channel
    Adafruit_NeoPixel* ledRing;      // Pointer to LED ring (nullptr if not used)
    uint16_t color;                  // HSV hue value for animation
    const char* ledPin;              // Physical pin description
    const char* description;         // Human-readable description
};
```

Then, I replaced the old arrays (`sensorChannels`, `sensorRings`, `ringColors`) with a single `sensorConfigs` array:

```cpp
// Combined configuration for all sensors - channels, LED rings, colors, and descriptions
// Physical layout:
// - Side A (D5-D7): Warm/earth tones
// - Side B (D2-D4): Cool tones
const SensorConfig sensorConfigs[MAX_SENSORS] = {
    {0, &sensorRingB3, 5461,  "D7", "ToF 0 -> LED D7 (warm: yellow-orange)"},
    {1, nullptr,       0,     "",   "ToF 1 (not used)"},
    {2, nullptr,       0,     "",   "ToF 2 (not used)"},
    {3, &sensorRingB1, 0,     "D5", "ToF 3 -> LED D5 (warm: red)"}, 
    {4, &sensorRingA3, 54613, "D4", "ToF 4 -> LED D4 (cool: magenta)"},
    {5, &sensorRingA2, 49151, "D3", "ToF 5 -> LED D3 (cool: blue-purple)"},
    {6, &sensorRingA1, 43690, "D2", "ToF 6 -> LED D2 (cool: blue)"},
    {7, &sensorRingB2, 10922, "D6", "ToF 7 -> LED D6 (warm: green)"}
};
```

Lastly, I updated the code in `setup()` and `loop()` to use this new `sensorConfigs` structure instead of the old individual arrays. This involved changing references like `sensorChannels[i]` to `sensorConfigs[i].channel`, `sensorRings[i]` to `sensorConfigs[i].ledRing`, and `ringColors[i]` to `sensorConfigs[i].color`. This makes the configuration much clearer and easier to manage going forward.
